# File Metadata Microservices API

Mini challenge completed for FCC in regards to learning APIs and microservices (for this challenge, Node/Express/Multer are used for API creation, Nodemon is used for live reloading, with allowed CORS policy).

User can submit a form that includes a file upload.

When the user submits a file, redirection to "/api/fileanalyse" is invoked and the user can see the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
